# 🌟 Contributing to EduBatch Academy

First off, you're awesome for wanting to contribute! 🎉 

This project started as a way to help one teacher, but with your help, it can help many more. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, every contribution makes a difference in someone's educational journey.

## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

## 🎨 Style Guide

- We use Prettier for formatting (because life's too short for formatting debates)
- Comments should be fun but helpful
- Variable names should make sense (no `x`, `y`, `z` unless you're plotting coordinates!)
- TypeScript types are your friends

## 🎮 Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173` and marvel at your work!

## 🧪 Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Run existing tests before submitting PR:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- If tests fail, fix them (or ask for help - we're friendly!)

## 📝 Documentation

Good documentation makes everyone's life easier:
- Update README.md if needed
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Update INTEGRATION.md for Firebase-related changes
- Create examples for complex features

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

1. Be nice to everyone
2. Help others learn
3. Remember we're all here to make education better
4. No gatekeeping - we were all beginners once
5. Have fun! 🎉

## 🎉 Recognition

Contributors get:
- Their name in the README
- Our eternal gratitude
- Good karma points
- The satisfaction of helping teachers and students

## 💭 Questions?

- Open an issue
- Start a discussion
- Send a carrier pigeon (just kidding, stick to GitHub!)

Remember: There's no such thing as a stupid question, only stupid answers (which we don't give here!)
