# 📚 EDU Batch Buddy

> Because every great teacher deserves great tools! 🎯

This project started as a labor of love - helping my high school teacher manage his growing tutoring center. What began as a simple booking system evolved into something that helped him focus more on teaching and less on paperwork. The best part? He used the time saved to offer free tutoring to underprivileged students! 💝

## 🌟 The Story Behind It

Picture this: A dedicated teacher, mountains of paper registers, and a student (me) who thought "there has to be a better way!" This app was born from:
- Late-night coding sessions fueled by memories of great teaching
- The joy of seeing "Oh wow, this is so much easier!" on my teacher's face
- The satisfaction of knowing technology can make a real difference

## ✨ Features

- 🎓 Smart batch management (Morning/Evening/Full Day/Private)
- 📝 One-click registration that just works
- 💳 Hassle-free payment handling
- 📱 Works beautifully on all devices
- 🎨 UI that sparks joy (Marie Kondo approved! 😉)
- 🔄 Demo mode for easy testing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript (because we like our code typed and our coffee strong!)
- **Build**: Vite (zoom zoom! ⚡)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui (beautiful components that make designers smile)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility classes FTW!)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (smooth like butter 🧈)
- **Forms**: Formik + Yup (because validation doesn't have to be painful)
- **Storage**: Firebase 🔥 (production) / localStorage (demo)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (the newer the better!)
- npm 9+ (comes with Node.js)
- A love for clean code (optional but recommended 😉)

## 🎯 Demo vs Production

This repo contains the demo version using localStorage for easy testing. For the production version with Firebase:

1. Check out [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) for Firebase setup
2. Replace the mock services with real ones
3. Add authentication and security rules
4. Deploy and celebrate! 🎉
